A payment service provider (PSP) offers shops online services for accepting electronic payments by a variety of payment methods including credit card, bank-based payments such as direct debit, bank transfer, and real-time bank transfer based on online banking. Typically, they use a software as a service model and form a single payment gateway for their clients (merchants) to multiple payment methods.

These services help the developer to integrate into their application payment systems easily. In particular, these services provide the libraries that are to be imported into your application to help manage the payment form. Each service provides a default form ready to be integrated in the application with a minimal interface(see \ref{sec:braintree} \ref{sec:stripe}).
