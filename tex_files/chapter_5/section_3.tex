\section{Payment component}
\label{sec:payment_component}
Until now it has been shown how the payments are handled internally. Let's now see how to mask this complexity in integrating the payment system in x-commerce.
\newline
All logic of the payment is hidden in the component \emph{payment-braintree}.
\newline
Following is illustrated in detail the use of the component \emph{payment-braintree}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=html]
<payment-braintree id="braintree"></payment-braintree>
\end{lstlisting}
So just import this tag to integrate into your system, the payments system. All these tasks are operated with the help of the web components.
\newline
The result of having imported this component is the following:

The management of payments with Stripe works in the same way but does not implement the logic of managing the task when the payment went bad. In fact, to import the payment form stripe just include the following tag:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=html]
<payment-stripe id="stripe"></payment-stripe>
\end{lstlisting}
The result of having imported this component is the following:
\begin{figure}[htb]

 \label{fig:brintree_form1}
