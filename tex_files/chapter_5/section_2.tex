\section{Execute tasks to retry payment}
\label{sec:tasks_to_retry_payment}
The payment of an order can have different outcomes in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item It can fail for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item error in data entry of credit card;
\item for network problems;
\item insufficient credit;
\item unknown reasons;
\end{itemize}
\item transaction successfully completed;
\end{itemize}
In each of these cases the customer e-commerce must be notified of the outcome of the transaction.
In the case in which the customer inserts the data of the credit card incorrect then it is immediately alerted.
If the data on the card are correct but there are other problems for which the first transaction fails to complete for reasons listed above, Braintree then returns a reply containing identifier of the failed transaction.
