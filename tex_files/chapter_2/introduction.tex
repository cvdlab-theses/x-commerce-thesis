This chapter describes X-Learning enabling technologies.
The first three sections concern server-side technologies: MongoDB, NodeJS and Loopback by Strongloop (an IBM company). MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database management system; NodeJS is an event-driven framework to handle Javascript server sides; Loopback is a NodeJS based framework created to use and edit set of APIs.
The fourth, fifth and sixth sections are related to client-side technologies: HTML5, Web Components and Polymer-Project by Google. HTML5 is a markup language aimed at web pages structuring; Web Components are a set of standards that allow for the creation of reusable widget and components in  web  documents;  Polymer-Project provides a thin layer  of API on top of Web Components and several powerful features, such as custom events, delegation, mixins, accessors and component life-cycle functions, to facilitate the creation of Web  Components.
