Another key point in the systems of e-commerce is the delivery and tracking of parcels. From the logistics point of view this is a very complicated problem to which we must pay close attention today because customer satisfaction is strongly dependent on the traceability of its services well. Through this feature the customer is aware of when you receive the order.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript]
var easypost = require('node-easypost')(apiKey);
// set addresses
var toAddress = {
    name: "Dr. Steve Brule",
    street1: "179 N Harbor Dr",
    city: "Redondo Beach",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "90277",
    country: "US",
    phone: "310-808-5243"
};
var fromAddress = {
    name: "EasyPost",
    street1: "118 2nd Street",
    street2: "4th Floor",
    city: "San Francisco",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "94105",
    phone: "415-123-4567"
};

// verify address
easypost.Address.create(fromAddress, function(err, fromAddress) {
    fromAddress.verify(function(err, response) {
        if (err) {
            console.log('Address is invalid.');
        } else if (response.message !== undefined && response.message !== null) {
            console.log('Address is valid but has an issue: ', response.message);
            var verifiedAddress = response.address;
        } else {
            var verifiedAddress = response;
        }
    });
});

// set parcel
easypost.Parcel.create({
    predefined_package: "InvalidPackageName",
    weight: 21.2
}, function(err, response) {
    console.log(err);
});

var parcel = {
    length: 10.2,
    width: 7.8,
    height: 4.3,
    weight: 21.2
};

// create customs_info form for intl shipping
var customsItem = {
    description: "EasyPost t-shirts",
    hs_tariff_number: 123456,
    origin_country: "US",
    quantity: 2,
    value: 96.27,
    weight: 21.1
};

var customsInfo = {
    customs_certify: 1,
    customs_signer: "Hector Hammerfall",
    contents_type: "gift",
    contents_explanation: "",
    eel_pfc: "NOEEI 30.37(a)",
    non_delivery_option: "return",
    restriction_type: "none",
    restriction_comments: "",
    customs_items: [customsItem]
};
// create shipment
easypost.Shipment.create({
    to_address: toAddress,
    from_address: fromAddress,
    parcel: parcel,
    customs_info: customsInfo
}, function(err, shipment) {
    // buy postage label with one of the rate objects
    shipment.buy({rate: shipment.lowestRate(['USPS', 'ups']), insurance: 100.00}, function(err, shipment) {
        console.log(shipment.tracking_code);
        console.log(shipment.postage_label.label_url);
    });
});
